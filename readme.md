This is just a new way to watch the Beach House - Lemon Glow music video. 

You can find more of thier music here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN-jxm11fOETNF5JrZsATCg

As noted above autoplay is unreliable. Its kinda fun to see the offset change. Some are better than others.

I think this used to work online. On github pages, but not anymore? I can't get it started.

It still works on localhost. I think this is an autoplay issue?

The good news? Updated with relative links. Clone into a subdirectory of a webserver and take a look!

Like this http://localhost/lemon-glow

Enjoy!
